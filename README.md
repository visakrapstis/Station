# Projekt Random 1. Face Recognition.
critics
  fixes required:
- grammar mistakes
- scrap wikipedia
- for better accuracy: maybe increase the amount of images for training?
- update the ml-functions, most likely the guess_image function / converting etc.. because the model is actually very inaccurate

# Projekt Random 2. Science-LLMs.
critics
science_llm: upload txt_data to talk about it (todo: Import other files .pdf, .csv. docx etc)
conversational_llm: working on llama3.2, but not accurate (TODO: change to groq? chatGPT?)
streamlit_app working fine, the model ("llama3.2") needs also fine tuning..

andvantages
code working fine
