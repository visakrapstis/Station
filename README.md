# Project Random 1. Face Recognition.
critics
  fixes required:
- grammar mistakes
- scrap wikipedia
- for better accuracy: maybe increase the amount of images for training?
- update the ml-functions, most likely the guess_image function / converting etc.. because the model is actually very inaccurate

# Project Random 2. Science-LLMs.
critics
science_llm: upload txt_data to talk about it (todo: Import other files .pdf, .csv. docx etc)
conversational_llm: working on llama3.2, but not accurate (TODO: change to groq? chatGPT?)
streamlit_app working fine, the model ("llama3.2") needs also fine tuning..

andvantages
code working fine

# Project Random 3. Crypto Sentiments
File Versuch 1 simple authentic ML Project. The model not suff. accurate, probably because of data. 
                                            In some cases very hard to understand the labels on the sentences
                                            from the dataset..
File Versuch 1.2 Simply promptengineering on sentiments

File Versuch 2: Crypto-news vs Bitcoin data with Tensorflow, trying-out: Neuronal Net. But Accuracy also not good enough

# Project Random 4. Google Apps
in general good, data cleaning, nice visual insights.
ML hard, as lables: paid / free chosen. MB thats the problem. To predict is very hard, because there are no reliable features on price.
